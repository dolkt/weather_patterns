# Weather Patterns Plotting
This project was part of a Data Science course taught at University of Michigan via [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-plotting/home/welcome).

Utilizing a chosen weather station, the objective was to:

1. Plot the record lowest and highest temperature for each day in a month for the period 2004 - 2014
2. Overlay a scatter plot showing the record lowest and highest temperatures for each day in a month in 2015 where the temperatures were even lower than the record lowest/highest in 2004 - 2014.
3. Miscellaneous data cleaning / data manipulation. Such as handling erroneous data.
